### Object Orienting Programming Â¨
# what is an object?
# object has methods and attributes that we can use with DOT method
#What is the purpose of OPP? To creat our own data-type!

## 4 PILLARS OF OOP

# ENCAPSULATION is binding of data & functions that manipulate the data

# ABSTRACTION means hiding of information or abstracting away information
# and giving access to only what's neccesary
   # Private vs Public variables

# private ? we use _varible's name to show that is a private variable
# but that has no power; it is just a convention to show to others not ot 
# over ride this variable

        print(f'Hi I am {self.name} and my color is {self.color}')
    
fruit1 = Fruit('apple', 'red')
fruit2 = Fruit('banana', 'yellow')
fruit3 = Fruit('pearl', 'green')

fruit1._name = '!!!!'
fruit1.speak = 'BOOOO'

# ENHERITANCE allows new objects to take on the properties of exicting object
